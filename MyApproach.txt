Description of my approach..


First i create account on Clarifai where i have got clientid and client secret key.

Then i added these key under key.js file.

create a model to storee image and coresponding tags associated with that image.

create a base.html file.

create a home.html file extending base.html to render the template

Under birthday.js file 
   first i select different div element using class and id selector.
	
    then i bind eventhandler on clicking the submit button.First one should have to enter the image url in given input field.Then click on submit button.

  On clicking over the submit button image will be submitted to CLarifai Api and predicted tags  generated then i'm returning the tag associated with submitted image.

Now, i'm storing the tags in temporary array and then using ajax request send it to backend.

In backend i'm considering image as key and tags associated with that image as value.

image --> key   ang tags--> value

When someone made a search on the basis of tag then then i made a query over the list of tags and then returnng the keys(image) of matching tags.

Also i've developed api of this project for makiing efficient search functionality using AngulayJs.
